# Skb tracking event

```none
#{tracking id} (skb {skb address})
```

The `tracking id` is a unique id generated by Retis' tracking logic. The socket
buffer address is also returned in the tracking events to help distinguish
between clones (as they share the same tracking id).

## Cross-Node Correlation

The `correlation_id` field enables matching the same packet across different nodes.
Use `tracking_id` for single-node tracing and `correlation_id` for cross-node.
Cross-node correlation is supported for TCP, UDP, and ICMP Echo packets. For
unsupported protocols, the field is set to 0.
